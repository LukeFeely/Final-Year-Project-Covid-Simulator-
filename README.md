# Final-Year-Project-Covid-Simulator-

This is an application developed for my Final Year Project for my degree at Trinity College. The predominant goal of this project was to develop a simulator which can aid in the understanding of the spread of viral diseases and empower young people to investigate the fundamental dynamics and trade-offs involved in the decision making process when it comes to managing such diseases.

It is build primarily in JavaScript and uses the mathematical S.E.I.R. model to model the simulations. The tool was used in a series of classes for Transition Year Students to evaluate its effectiveness. Full documentation and analysis on this application can be found in the attached Dissertation File. 
A working version of the application can be found at: https://covid-simulator-tcd.herokuapp.com/ <b>No Longer Hosted :(</b>
